# Computer-Vision-Programs
MATLAB programs relating to the discipline of Computer Vision

PDFs showcase sample outputs of these programs with sample inputs

RGB_Regions:
	
	Specify which RGB values to retain color, and turn all other pixels to grayscale.
	
Image_Similarity:
	
	Calculates two similarity percentages of two images on the basis of gradience and color histograms.
	
Nearest_Neighbor_Interpolation:
	
	Takes an input image and increases the image size by an integer factor using nearest neighbor interpolation.

Edge_Detection_Outline
	
	Detects the boundary of a specified color region and outlines the boundary of that region in a particular color.

Distance Traveled:
	
	Calculates the distance of a vehicle traveled in feet from 2 still frames, as well as calculating speed given 
	the time between the frames.

Frequency_Domain_Filtering:

	Shows the process of filtering a distorted image in the frequency domain through MATLAB, resulting in an image that
	would not have been able to be cleaned up if attempted to be filtered in the spatial domain.
