MATLAB programs relating to the discipline of Computer Vision

PDFs showcase sample outputs of these programs with sample inputs

RGB_Regions:
	
	Specify which RGB values to retain color, and turn all other pixels to grayscale.
	
Image_Similarity:
	
	Calculates two similarity percentages of two images on the basis of gradience and color histograms.
	
Nearest_Neighbor_Interpolation:
	
	Takes an input image and increases the image size by an integer factor using nearest neighbor interpolation.

Edge_Detection_Outline
	
	Detects the boundary of a specified color region and outlines the boundary of that region in a particular color.

Distance Traveled:
	
	Calculates the distance of a vehicle traveled in feet from 2 still frames, as well as calculating speed given 
	the time between the frames.
